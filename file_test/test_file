This is the first line of my testfile.
I'm trying to see if.
I can read multiple lines.
Whatever the lenght.
Of.
Aaid line.

And I'm not sure what would happen if I put an empty line in the middle of my file.
I don't even know how I can tell my program to print only a single line.
What even is "a line" ??
So many questions...

Like if I write some kind of super-long sentence with no newline character, I wonder what would happen, like is it supposed to read it until I write a backslash n ?
Let's try it out !
Ca me soul ce truc de ces grand mort !!!
